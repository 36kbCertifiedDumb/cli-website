## Cloudflare Products Used
This project uses the following Cloudflare products in addition to Cloudflare Pages / Workers Assets:

- **Cloudflare Pages** — static hosting for the main smol website  
- **Cloudflare Turnstile** — human verification protecting self-hosted backend (Immich / Owncast)  
- **Cloudflare DNS** — domain and subdomain routing  
- **Cloudflare Registrar (Domain)** — domain management for yueplush.com and subdomains  
- **Cloudflare CDN / Cache** — global static content delivery  
- **Cloudflare Zero Trust Access** — if enabled, used to protect internal endpoints  

This section is included to comply with the submission rules of Cloudflare’s What-I-Built channel.

   ▼ Technical demo and source code of 
     what happens when you make a website as lightweight as possible.

▼ my sites how to build up this  
yeah technically its just almost 20KB ultra-low size index.html  
and it just 8KB style.css combined for that.  
but Self-hosted part(kinda immich gallery or some),  
i separated turnstile htmls for subdomain backend system,  
its just simple website  
i know its insane, but actually happend this.

For example, I'm a big fan of  
© From Software / Armored Core's  
intentional "purging of all heavy parts" approach,  
which allows for ultra-mobility and lightweight design,  
thereby enabling a variety of functions.  

So, I went out of my way to trim down the site's file structure and  
source code file size to the bare minimum, and just for fun,  
I tried this approach with a  
Cloudflare configuration (disabling all crawler settings),

and something went "happend".

Of course, for security reasons,  
the self-hosted gallery(immich) portion bypassed by the Cloudflare tunnel is  
protected by Turnstiles stored in a subdomain,  
so only humans should actually be able to access the gallery.

### ▼ thoughts or something
just CLI websites, i just create for hobby but some reason,  
web perforcmance has REAL, so i admit, to deploy and share MIT License  
for WebDev Community, its just Education stuff for old school thing.

but i think i found for solution "Vaccine" for their Expanding WebDev Warfare tbh  
We honestly create new problems to solve the problems we created.  
I present only one answer to  
this never-ending Webdev Expanding Warfare under the MIT license.

just for fun. ;)

Our future going to maybe WEB3.0 or something,  
but return to origin, its WEB1.0, then finally i understand "why we use Internet"  
its just simple "deliver my creation for never knowing stranger"  
but many Websites kinda illusion for this, everyone continues to turn a blind eye to it.

Even NPOs that help poor areas use extremely heavy frameworks. I understand the reason,  
but you may not be able to reach the users you really want to reach.  
For example, even in 2025, there will still be dial-up users.

yeah, also you can do this.  
we should "hack the planet" once again.

GOD Bless WebDev Community!

## Monologue

▼ What did an unemployed DevOps see after minimizing development to the bare minimum?

I arrived at one truth. modern web development is a never-ending arms race,  
constantly creating new problems to solve the problems we create ourselves.  
Frameworks make development easier, but they slow down sites.  
Optimization tools are created to solve these problems.  
Analytics tools help us understand users,  
but they violate their privacy and make sites even slower.  
Advertising generates revenue, but they destroy the user experience...

I realized that all of this was a huge,  
complex illusion designed to distract us from a single,  
simple goal. delivering content to users.

And so, I withdrew from the arms race.  
I threw away all my weapons, stripped away all my armor,  
and single-mindedly pursued speed. What I saw wasn't "nothing".

What I saw was the very core of the web,  
what remains after all the noise has faded away.

It was a simple my beautiful sight,  
a creator handing pure information to a receiver,  
with respect, in the most efficient way.

The moment I stopped pursuing wealth (traffic)  
and technical complexity (functionality),  
I gained the true "power" of the web,  
the reliability of the ability to instantly and  
reliably deliver value to anyone, in any environment.

I did not see the image of an engineer who had lost his job,  
but rather the image of an artist who had been freed from  
all illusions and rediscovered the true essence of the web.
