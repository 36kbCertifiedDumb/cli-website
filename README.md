▼Technical something
just CLI websites, i just create for hobby but some reason,
web perforcmance has REAL, so i admit, to deploy and share MIT License
for WebDev Community, 
i think i found for solution "Vaccine" for their Expanding WebDev Warfare tbh
We honestly create new problems to solve the problems we created. 
I present only one answer to this never-ending 
Webdev Expanding Warfare under the MIT license. just for fun. ;)

Our future going to maybe WEB3.0 or something, 
but return to origin, its WEB1.0, then finally i understand "why we use Internet"
its just simple "deliver my creation for never knowing stranger" 
but many Websites kinda illusion for this, everyone continues to turn a blind eye to it.

Even NPOs that help poor areas use extremely heavy frameworks. I understand the reason, 
but you may not be able to reach the users you really want to reach. 
For example, even in 2025, there will still be dial-up users.

yeah, also you can do this. 
we should "hack the planet" once again.

GOD Bless WebDev Community!
