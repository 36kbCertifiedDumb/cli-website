# ▼my sites how to build up this<br>
yeah technically its just almost 20KB ultra-low size index.html<br>
and it just 8KB style.css combined for that.<br>
but Self-hosted part(kinda immich gallery or some), <br>
i separated turnstile htmls for subdomain backend system,<br>
its just simple website<br>
i know its insane, but actually happend this.<br>
<br>
For example, I'm a big fan of <br>
© From Software / Armored Core's <br>
intentional "purging of all heavy parts" approach, <br>
which allows for ultra-mobility and lightweight design, <br>
thereby enabling a variety of functions. <br>
So, I went out of my way to trim down the site's file structure and <br>
source code file size to the bare minimum, and just for fun, <br>
I tried this approach with a <br>
Cloudflare configuration (disabling all crawler settings), <br>
<br>
and something went "happend".<br>
<br>
Of course, for security reasons, <br>
the self-hosted gallery(immich) portion bypassed by the Cloudflare tunnel is <br>
protected by Turnstiles stored in a subdomain, <br>
so only humans should actually be able to access the gallery.<br>
<br>
## ▼thoughs or something<br>
just CLI websites, i just create for hobby but some reason,<br>
web perforcmance has REAL, so i admit, to deploy and share MIT License<br>
for WebDev Community, its just Education stuff for old school thing.<br>
<br>
but i think i found for solution "Vaccine" for their Expanding WebDev Warfare tbh<br>
We honestly create new problems to solve the problems we created. <br>
I present only one answer to <br>
this never-ending Webdev Expanding Warfare under the MIT license. <br>
<br>
just for fun. ;)<br>
<br>
Our future going to maybe WEB3.0 or something, <br>
but return to origin, its WEB1.0, then finally i understand "why we use Internet"<br>
its just simple "deliver my creation for never knowing stranger" <br>
but many Websites kinda illusion for this, everyone continues to turn a blind eye to it.<br>
<br>
Even NPOs that help poor areas use extremely heavy frameworks. I understand the reason, <br>
but you may not be able to reach the users you really want to reach. <br>
For example, even in 2025, there will still be dial-up users.<br>
<br>
yeah, also you can do this. <br>
we should "hack the planet" once again.<br>
<br>
GOD Bless WebDev Community!<br>

## Monologue <br>
### What did an unemployed DevOps see after minimizing development to the bare minimum?<br>
<br>
I arrived at one truth: modern web development is a never-ending arms race, <br>
constantly creating new problems to solve the problems we create ourselves.<br>
Frameworks make development easier, but they slow down sites. <br>
Optimization tools are created to solve these problems. <br>
Analytics tools help us understand users, <br>
but they violate their privacy and make sites even slower. <br>
Advertising generates revenue, but they destroy the user experience...<br>
<br>
I realized that all of this was a huge, <br>
complex illusion designed to distract us from a single, <br>
simple goal: delivering content to users.<br>
<br>
And so, I withdrew from the arms race.<br>
I threw away all my weapons, stripped away all my armor, <br>
and single-mindedly pursued speed. What I saw wasn't "nothing".<br>
<br>
What I saw was the very core of the web, <br>
what remains after all the noise has faded away.<br>
<br>
It was a simple my beautiful sight, <br>
a creator handing pure information to a receiver, <br>
with respect, in the most efficient way.<br>
<br>
The moment I stopped pursuing wealth (traffic) <br>
and technical complexity (functionality), <br>
I gained the true "power" of the web, <br>
the reliability of the ability to instantly and<br>
reliably deliver value to anyone, in any environment.<br>
<br>
I did not see the image of an engineer who had lost his job, <br>
but rather the image of an artist who had been freed from <br>
all illusions and rediscovered the true essence of the web.<br>
<br>
