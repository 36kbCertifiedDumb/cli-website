▼Technical something<br>
just CLI websites, i just create for hobby but some reason,<br>
web perforcmance has REAL, so i admit, to deploy and share MIT License<br>
for WebDev Community, <br>
i think i found for solution "Vaccine" for their Expanding WebDev Warfare tbh<br>
We honestly create new problems to solve the problems we created. <br>
I present only one answer to this never-ending Webdev Expanding Warfare under the MIT license. <br>
just for fun. ;)<br>
<br>
Our future going to maybe WEB3.0 or something, <br>
but return to origin, its WEB1.0, then finally i understand "why we use Internet"<br>
its just simple "deliver my creation for never knowing stranger" <br>
but many Websites kinda illusion for this, everyone continues to turn a blind eye to it.<br>
<br>
Even NPOs that help poor areas use extremely heavy frameworks. I understand the reason, <br>
but you may not be able to reach the users you really want to reach. <br>
For example, even in 2025, there will still be dial-up users.<br>
<br>
yeah, also you can do this. <br>
we should "hack the planet" once again.<br>
<br>
GOD Bless WebDev Community!<br>
